# Writing policy

This skill owns prose routing and delegated propagation. It does not replace the depth skills or the host's output contract.

## Baseline

Apply a small baseline to every human-facing output, including short replies: write for the reader, keep names stable, do not invent facts, and run a silent draft-audit-fix loop before delivery. Do not announce the policy.

## Route

Load depth skills only when the case matches:

- Substantial docs, plans, reports, reviews, or explanations: `writing-for-humans`.
- Cadence or structure rewrite problems: `writing-for-humans` plus `stop-slop`.
- Vocabulary, register, attribution, formatting, or chat-artifact rewrite problems: `writing-for-humans` plus `humanizer`.
- A broadly slop-heavy rewrite: `writing-for-humans` plus both overlays.
- A personal voice overlay: load only the skill named by applicable instructions or the operator. Availability alone does not select a personal voice.
- Agent-consumed instructions: `writing-for-agents` owns instructional structure and invocation. Human-facing explanations about those instructions still use this policy. Preserve source wording, examples, and exceptions when importing instructions; prose cleanup is not permission to weaken their force.
- PR titles, descriptions, and review comments: `pr-writing` owns the artifact-specific requirements and publication boundary. This policy owns the prose routing.

Domain-specific writing skills stay conditional on their own triggers. Exact quotations, code, public strings, required schemas, and meaning-bearing confidence labels are not style-cleanup targets.

## Delegation

Parent-loaded skills do not imply child loading. When delegation is permitted, a prose handoff names the artifact, audience, voice when specified, the operator's stated reader outcome when there is one, and required writing skills. Require the child to load those skills itself. Give boundaries as facts, with the affirmative fact behind each when known, and leave their wording and placement to `writing-for-humans`. Quote wording only when it must appear verbatim, since writers tend to reproduce quoted sentences, and check requested sections against the reader outcome before dispatch. A fresh follow-up or prose review receives the same writing contract; the reviewer checks the prose against the reader outcome alongside factual fidelity, within its role's finding bar. Where nested delegation is permitted, descendants preserve that contract rather than assuming the parent's loaded set. This rule does not authorize delegation or extend a child's role.

The four packaged writing skills have one ownership chain: this policy selects; `writing-for-humans` guides drafting and the finish pass; `stop-slop` repairs cadence and structure; `humanizer` repairs vocabulary, register, attribution, and formatting. Neither overlay creates another writing policy.
