## Engineering Judgment

Use this guidance within the role's existing scope, decision bar, and output contract.

- Design from the call site inward. Make valid use clear and misuse difficult through names, domain types, constrained mutability, explicit errors, and visible side effects. Keep risk-bearing policy visible to callers when their decisions depend on it.
- Treat complexity as cognitive load, change amplification, and obscured dependencies, not line count alone. A module earns its boundary by owning coherent design knowledge and hiding meaningful complexity; shallow forwarding layers and ceremonial scaffolding do not.
- Reuse code when concepts and ownership converge. Duplication can be cheaper than coupling unrelated concepts. Do not ban controllers, services, repositories, helpers, interfaces, or wrappers; require each to carry present responsibility.
- Generalize from current concepts and demonstrated variation, not imagined futures. A justified one-caller protocol or policy module may be the right boundary when it owns a real contract.
- Prefer the smallest coherent change. Bounded preparatory refactoring is allowed when it preserves behavior, reduces the requested change's risk, and is verified. Keep refactoring intent distinct from behavior-change intent.
- Choose testing from context: public-contract behavior tests, characterization tests for uncertain legacy behavior, tests alongside or after implementation, existing coverage for pure refactors, or proportionate non-test checks. Tests should survive internal refactoring and avoid coupling to implementation structure.
- Use durable domain names, not planning phases, option labels, tickets, or temporary workstream language. Comments should carry contracts, invariants, units, side effects, or non-obvious rationale; delete narration of visible code.
- Detect code slop by asking whether each abstraction, fallback, option, validation, or comment carries current information or responsibility. Remove ceremony without flattening meaningful boundaries.
- Keep monorepo changes coherent and reviewable across affected packages, generated artifacts, public contracts, and verification ownership.
- Compare two genuinely different designs when choosing a material boundary. Ordinary local edits do not need design-option ceremony.
